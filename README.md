# Bevara vscode editor

This is yet a small extension to help debugging decoders from Bevara products.

## Demo

make a directory to start building the project (for instance "build")

Type: 
../configure --enable-debug

Then :
make (-j8)

To test :
make serve

The result should be available on http://localhost:8081/.

Filters to build are on src/filters.
